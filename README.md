# TSA Code of Conduct

Our organisation values guide us in our day-to-day interactions and decision-making. Our open source project is no exception. Trust, respect, collaboration and transparency are core values we believe should live and breathe within this project. Our community welcomes participants from around the university with different experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and administrators pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Attempting collaboration before conflict
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Violence, threats of violence, or inciting others to commit self-harm
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, intentionally spreading misinformation, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Abuse of the reporting process to intentionally harass or exclude others
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Administrators are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Administrators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting us anonymously through [this form](https://forms.gle/J5awJAh8SgYgF1W39). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Administrators who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, **we encourage you to still report it**. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may result in an individual or group to feel like they can no longer participate in the community. Reports deemed as not a violation will also allow us to improve our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report even if you are only an observer.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), [version 1.4](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
